1. Create a UI screen space canvas with a slider that indicates a timer. Arrange the timer at the bottom center of the canvas' visible field.
2. Go to "Assets/Scripts/ColliderDetector.cs" and connect it to the UI script. When player (plane) passing through a gate, adds some amount of time to the UI timer.
3. Create a new text field. Arrange the text field bottom right corner of the canvas' visible field. Use the text field to count how many gates the plane passes. 
4. Add an image and use it for a splash screen covering all visible canvas' area. Rename the image's gameobject "GameOverScreen".
5. Implement a logic that will show the game over splash screen when:
	a. Crash the plane (implemented in "ColliderDetector.cs").
	b. The countdown timer is equal to or lower than 0.
	c. The player(the plane) passes all gates.
6. Create a UI button that will restart the game. Arrange the button at the top left corner of the canvas' visible field.
	To restart the game use "UnityEngine.SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene("{SceneName}");" https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.SceneManager.LoadScene.html
	To make it work is mandatory to add the scene in the BuildSettings.
7. Fix the UI anchors to all UI elements to prevent disappearing when resizing the game view.
